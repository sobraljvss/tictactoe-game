# Tic Tac Toe Game

A tic tac toe game fully made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's possible to play as both Player vs CPU and Player vs Player between each round. The CPU is smart enough to perceive a win opportunity and catch it.

#### Examples

    <img src="imgs/pc_screen_example_two.png" alt="PC-like screen: example two" style="width: 500px">
